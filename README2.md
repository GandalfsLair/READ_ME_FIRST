WHAT IS THIS?

This is my ongoing project to try to create computer code and programs that, when run, will allow the user to look like they are engaging in activity
that could be interpreted as Computer Hacking.
It is designed as a Live Roleplaying resource.

WHY?

Because I have played in a number of games where characters can engage in Computer Hacking, but what that actually looks like is left in the hands of
the player themseves. All this does is give the player something to actually do... or be seen to be doing... during that time. 

IS THERE A BEST WAY TO DO THIS?

In most cases the best advise is to download the code that you need to the computer you want to run it on. 
Store these files in a same high level folder. It does not matter if you have subfolders to hold individual files but they should all be held under 
one main folder.
Download MicroSoft Visual Studio Code ( See:- https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Once you install MS VSC, open and run it. 
Under File, select 'Open Folder' and select the one main folder that hold all your downloaded code.
Select Extensions (the lowest icon of those displayed on the left of MS VSC) and enter LiveServer in the search bar
Install LiveServer (You may need to restart the program during this process)

Now, when you open a folder that holds code you click on the code. This will mainly be the HTML file.
Right Click on the mouse for the options menu. 
In the options menu you should see 'Open with LiveServer'. Select this. 

The code should now be spun up in your browser without needing to mess about with HTTP servers or other mechanisms to allow safe viewing of code.
If you try to run code by double clicking the icon, you will get some functionality but unless the code is especially simple, you will not get all
the functionality.

ANYTHING ELSE?

The batch files only run on Windows Machines. These may not work depending on the security settings of your device. Please play around to see.

The Static Web Hosting option will only work if you have devices with internet access.
