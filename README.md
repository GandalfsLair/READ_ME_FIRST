This code is part of my Live Roleplay Computer Hacking Project and is released under the Creative Commons Licence.

In short - I may have the incorrect title of the licence but the intention is that anyone can: 
1. Copy the code 
2. Alter the code in anyway 
3. Use the code for any non-profit activity * 
4. Share the code 
 
So long as the following conditions are met: 
a. The activity is for non-profit activity * 
b. The original source of the code is quoted 
c. If the code is used, please let me know just so I know that someone is getting a use out of it 
d. If you feel like sharing your version(s) with me I would be fascinated to see what others come up with. 
e. if you have other ideas please let me know and I can see if I can incorporate them. 
f. You realise/recognise that I am not a coder, and that anything I create will be the result of borrowing from others or long periods of trial and error.

* - 'Non-Profit' has not been defined and is left in the hands of the user. 
  - The idea here is that so long as 'The User' (being the person who is using this computer code or any computer code derived from it)
  - is not actively making money for themselves out of this computer code or any computer code derived from it, then the spirit of this 
  - provision has been met. I leave this in your own capable hands and in the knowledge that most people are good and decent and will
  - do the right thing (or at least act in the spirit of this provision where they can).

Many thanks
